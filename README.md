# Hacktober Fest Blog Project ðŸŽƒ

## Share your knowledge

Not all contributions to open source are code. Open source contributions can take the form of thought-leadership via blog posts, interviews and talks among many forms.

If you feel the most comfortable contributing to open source through your writing, then I challenge you to share your knowledge via the Hacktoberfest Blog Project.

The Hacktober Fest Blog Project is a compilation of user contributed blog posts. Blog posts can be about anything: tool tips, productivity tips, tutorials, talk reviews, podcast recommendations. You can even contribute blog posts you've written for your personal blog or other publications.

All of these blog posts will be compiled into a free ebook at the end of the month!

TL;DR Contribute your blog posts. They will be compiled into an awesome free ebook at the end of the month. YAY Hactober Fest!

### How to contribute

This is a Jekyll blog, you don't have to do anything but write your blog post in Markdown :)

If you're unfamiliar with Jekyll, I wrote a [blog post](http://cecycorrea.com/development/2017/02/06/getting-started-with-jekyll.html) on how to get started with Jekyll.

Repo owner (me) will push your post and make it live after approving your PR. You will be sent a link to your blog post as a response to your PR.

**Step 1:** Fork this repo and create a branch on your fork for your post.

**Step 2:** Write a blog post. If you're unfamiliar with Jekyll, don't worry. It's easy. Essentially, all posts go in the `_posts` folders and follow this convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-your-post.markdown`.

There is a handy rake task you can use to auto generate the file for you. Just type `rake post:new` and follow the prompt.

**Step 3:** Write your post! You can use [Github flavored markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Please include your name and social media link/ email in the [post frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/). Example:

```
layout: post
title: My awesome blog post
author: Johnny Joestar
twitter: https://twitter.com/jjoestar
website: https://my-awesome-site.com
github: https://github.com/jjoestar
```

You can either leave blank or omit fields in the frontmatter you don't want. **Do not change the layout though!** Layout and title are required for Jekyll to work.

**Step 4:** Submit your PR!

Once your PR is approved, repo owner (me!) will merge and deploy to Github Pages. The blog, for now, will be hosted on `cecyc.github.io/hacktoberfest-blog`.
